# Stock Prediction
Based on the historical data, the application is able to predict the future price. The accuracy of the price is calculated.

We have used many models to predict the prices.
- Logistic Regression
- Quadratic 
- Lasso
- Ridge

# Set-up steps: 
- install matplotlib, matplotlib and optional pandas_datareader via conda command line
- run stock_prediction.ipynb in Jupyter notebook

Note: pandas_datareader did not work for NSE lebels, need to investigate
